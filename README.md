Problem Statement:
Managing personal notes, images, and videos in a unified and organized manner can be challenging, especially when traditional diaries or scattered digital tools fail to integrate multimedia content effectively. This lack of organization can lead to inefficiencies and the inability to reflect on personal growth over time.

Solution:
A Digital Diary application offers a seamless platform to record text entries alongside multimedia such as images and videos, ensuring everything is stored securely and accessibly in one place. By integrating features like media upload, camera capture, and automatic timestamping, it provides an efficient and intuitive way to document and revisit personal memories.
